Credit Card Complaint Dashboard:
Overview
The Credit Card Complaint Dashboard provides a visual analysis of credit card complaints received by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The dashboard is designed to offer an intuitive and interactive way to explore and understand the nature, volume, and trends of complaints across different geographies, time periods, and categories. It allows stakeholders, such as customer service teams, financial analysts, and regulatory bodies, to gain valuable insights into the customer experience and identify areas for improvement in credit card services.

Data Sources
The dashboard utilizes publicly available data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The data encompasses a wide range of variables related to credit card complaints, including:

Complaint IDs: Unique identifiers for each complaint.
Submission Date: The date when the complaint was submitted.
Company Name: The financial institution against which the complaint was filed.
State and Zip Code: The location of the complainant.
Complaint Type: Categories of complaints (e.g., billing disputes, fraud, interest rate issues).
Response Timeliness: Whether the company responded to the complaint in a timely manner.
Complaint Status: The current status of the complaint (e.g., closed with explanation, closed with monetary relief).

Goal
The primary goal of the Credit Card Complaint Dashboard is to enhance the understanding of customer grievances related to credit card services and to enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. By visualizing complaint trends and patterns, the dashboard aims to:

Identify the most common types of complaints.
Analyze the geographical distribution of complaints.
Track the response and resolution rates of companies.
Highlight areas needing improvement to enhance customer satisfaction and compliance.

Roles and Responsibilities
In developing the dashboard, several roles and responsibilities were undertaken:

Data Analyst:

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify key metrics and trends.

Tableau Developer:
Designed and built the Tableau dashboard using best practices for data visualization.
Created interactive elements such as filters, drill-downs, and tooltips to enhance user experience.

Top Complaint Categories: The most frequent types of complaints relate to billing disputes, identity theft, and interest rate issues. This highlights areas where customers face the most challenges and where companies might need to improve their services.

Geographical Trends: Certain states exhibit a higher volume of complaints, suggesting potential regional issues or concentrations of dissatisfied customers. For example, populous states like California, Texas, and Florida often show higher complaint rates, which could be due to larger customer bases or specific regional challenges.

Company Performance: The dashboard enables a comparative analysis of different companies based on the number of complaints and their response times. It shows that some companies consistently resolve complaints more quickly than others, suggesting varying levels of customer service quality across the industry.

Response Timeliness and Resolution: Companies with higher rates of timely responses tend to have better overall resolution statuses, such as "closed with explanation" or "closed with relief." This indicates that timely responses are a crucial factor in effective complaint management and customer satisfaction.

Temporal Analysis: Complaint volumes fluctuate over time, with noticeable spikes during certain months. This temporal analysis can help companies identify underlying factors contributing to these spikes, such as economic conditions, regulatory changes, or marketing campaigns.

Conclusion
